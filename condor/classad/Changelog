This software is is released under the CONDOR (r) PUBLIC LICENSE open-source
license.  See ../../LICENSE.TXT.

Changes from release 2.1 to 2.2 of the Java classad implementation.

* Bug fixes
    - ClassAdSAXHandler.getResult()
        pop result off the stack rather than leaving it there
    - Fixed handling various mixtures of UNDEFINED and ERROR arguments to
        strict builtin functions
    - Fixed handling of BOOL==BOOL or BOOL!=BOOL
    - Fixed recognition of reserved words.  Previous code had a bug in which
        "is_foo" was recognized as the reserved word "is"
    - Fixed typo in pattern for relative time constants in the XML schema
* New methods
    Expr.sameAs(Expr)
    ClassAdParser.curLine() ClassAdParser.curColumn()
    ClassAdWriter.setRepresentation(int)
    ClassAdWriter.getRepresentation()
    Constant.equals(Object) and Constant.hashCode() so that Constants can be
        stored in hash tables
* New/changed builtin functions in classads
    new
        member identicalMember
        isUndefined isError isString isInteger isReal isList isClassad
        isBoolean isAbstime isReltime
        random toupper tolower regex splitTime
        formatTime
    renamed
        unixTime to time
        timeInterval to interval
    deleted
        gmtTime
    deprecated
        gmtTimeString localTimeString glob iglob
    added tests to for the new/changed functions
* Added facilities for non-strict functions (necessary for isError and
    isUndefined)
* Clarified copyright:  everything is covered by the Condor Public License.
* Misc improvement of comments, javadoc, code organization, etc.

Details by file:

AttrName.java
    unchanged
AttrRef.java
    new method sameAs
Builtin.java
    import regex
    change header comment
    rearranged methods to match refman
    new builtin functions
        member identicalMember
        isUndefined isError isString isInteger isReal isList isClassad
        isBoolean isAbstime isReltime
        random toupper tolower regex splitTime
        formatTime
    renamed functions
        unixTime to time
        timeInterval to interval
    deleted function gmtTime
    replaced Constant.TYPE (for various values of TYPE) with Expr.TYPE.
        These constants are defined in Expr and inherited by Constant.  To
        write (e.g.) Constant.LIST is misleading.
ClassAd.java
    fix comments for bind, eval, match, loadJavaLibrary
ClassAdParser.java
    new methods curLine and curColumn
ClassAdReader.java
    unchanged
ClassAdSAXHandler.java
    fixed method getResult to use pop rather than peek. Otherwise, this handler
        is not reusable
ClassAdWriter.java
    rearranged members
    added better comments to delimit sections
    new methods setRepresentation and getRepresentation to
        allow a writer to switch dynamically between XML and native outout
    added support for non-strict functions
CondExpr.java
    new method sameAs
Constant.java
    new method sameAs
    fixed documentation of method getInstance(boolean)
    override methods equals() and hashCode() so that Constants can be stored in
        hash tables
Env.java
    move nested class Env to top level (Env.java)
Expr.java
    move nested class Env to top level (Env.java)
    new method sameAs
    rearranged order of code to improve readability
    added support for non-strict functions
FuncCall.java
    fixed handling of case where some args are UNDEFINED and some are ERROR
    added cross-reference to ClassAd.loadJavaLibary
    added support for non-strict functions
        store args as a List rather than Expr[]
    improved comments to explain how varargs works
    new method sameAs
GetOpt.java
    unchanged
ListExpr.java
    new method sameAs
Op.java
    fixed handling of BOOL==BOOL or BOOL!=BOOL
    new method sameAs
    use a switch statement rather than nested ifs to improve readability
    added support for non-strict functions
Query.java
    unchanged
README
    fix copyright (Condor Public License rather than LGPL)
RecordExpr.java
    new method sameAs
SelectExpr.java
    new method sameAs
SubscriptExpr.java
    new method sameAs
classad.y
    fixed recognition of reserved words.  Previous code had a bug in which
        "is_foo" was recognized as the reserved word "is"
    new methods curLine and curColumn
    added support for non-strict functions
        store function args as a List rather than Expr[]
classads.dtd
    unchanged
classads.xsd
    fixed typo in pattern for relative time constants
classes.make
    move nested class Env to top level (Env.java)
package.html
    update version and date
refman.tex
    removed builtin functions glob and iglob
    added builtin functions
        member, identicalMember
        isUndefined, isInteger, etc.
        splittime, formatTime, random, regexp
    clarified representation of absolute times.
    clarified strictness in functions. The is* functions are not strict.
    clarified that toupper and tolower convert their arguments to strings
        first
    consistently use capitalized names Integer, Real, etc. for types of ClassAd
        expressions.
Makefile
    fix copyright
analysis/tests
    fix copyright
tests/CATest.java
    new tester program
tests/Makefile
    new program CATest
    new var MAIN_CLASS
    new targets demo.jar, clean, interactive, batch
    fixed tests so that diffs run clean rather than with 4 "expected" diffs
tests/batch_test
    add a simple test to demonstrate how CATest works.  Use it in the "batch:"
        makefile target
tests/classes.make
    added CATest.java
tests/scripts/expr.1.{test,data}
    added tests for BOOL==BOOL and BOOL!=BOOL
tests/scripts/expr.2.{test,data}
    added tests for toupper, tolower, regex
tests/scripts/expr.3.{test,data}
    added tests for isUndefined, isError, isString, isInteger, etc.
    added tests for random
tests/scripts/expr.4.{test,data}
    rename unixTime to time, timeInterval to interval
    new tests for formatTime
    add "VARIABLE" string to tests that vary from run to run (e.g. use random
        or current time) so that diff can ignore them.
tests/scripts/expr.5.{test,data}
    new tests for member, identicalMember
