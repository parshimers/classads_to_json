Classes to read and write binary data in a format compatible with the
Condor Cedar C++ library.
The API (application programming interface) is meant to be compatible with Java
rules and conventions and as such is quite different fromt he Cedar API, but
the format of data transmitted and received "over the wire" is compatible with
the C++ verison, with the exception of floats and doubles (which are hopelessly
broken in the C++ version).
<p>
In particular,
<ul>
<li>Floats and doubles are sent using the Java serialization, which means they
are sent in their in-memory (IEEE 754) format, most significant byte (MSB)
first, as four or eight bytes.
<li>All other primitive types are converted to 8-byte long integers and sent in
network byte order (big-endian; MSB first).  They are sign-extended on output
and truncated on input.  In particular,
<ul><li>booleans are sent as false = 0 and true = 1 and received as
0 = false, non-zero = true.
<li>characters are zero-extended to 64 bits on output and truncated to 16 bits
on input.
</ul>
<li>Strings are sent by converting bytes using Java UTF-8 and then appending a
zero byte.  They are received by scanning up to a zero byte and
reversing the UTF-8 encoding.  In the particular case that the
string has nothing but ASCII characaters (1..127), this is essentially
the identity transformation (trailing zero added on output and stripped
on input).  Note that Java UTF-8 has the property that the encoded
stream does not contain null bytes.
</ul>
Applications are expected to use methods readUTF and writeUTF to transmit
strings.  The methods {@link condor.cedar.CedarOutputStream#writeChars(String)}
and {@link condor.cedar.CedarInputStream#readLine()} are provided for
compatibility with the DataOutput and DataInput interfaces, but they are
deprecated.
<p>
The encoded data stream is divided into "messages", which are further
sub-divided in to "packets".  Message boundaries have end-to-end
significance; packet boundaries are hidden in the implementation.
No data element ever crosses a message boundary.
<p>
Each packet is preceded by a packet header:  A one-byte EOM
(end-of-message) indicator (non-zero indicates that this is the last
packet of a message) followed by a length as a network-byte-order 32
bit unsigned integer. The length does not include the header itself,
so a zero-length packet (one with no payload) has a length field
containing 0.  Packet boundaries are totally transparent on input.
<p>
On output, a packet is flushed when a fixed-size buffer fills, or
on a call to flush(), close(), or endOfMessage().  If the current
output buffer is empty, flush() has no effect.  Message boundaries
are indicated on output by the method
<pre>
    void endOfMessage()
</pre>
which forces out a packet with the EOM flag sent containing any
buffered data.  Note that an EOM packet may be empty, but a non-EOM
packet is never empty.  An implicit or explicit close implies an
endOfMessage() if any data has been output since the last
endOfMessage().
<p>
On input, the EOM "marker" acts like EOF:  An attempt to read past it
throws an EOFException.  The method available() returns the number of
unread bytes in the current input packet.  If the current packet has
been totally consumed (or was empty) and has the EOM bit sent,
available() returns zero.  If the current packet has been consumed but
does not have EOM set, another packet is read, and available() returns
the size of that packet (which will be non-zero unless it is an EOM
packet).  Thus available() only returns zero when the end of a message
is encountered.  The method
<pre>
    boolean nextMessage()
</pre>
skips past the end of the current message and positions the input
stream to start reading the next message.  If EOF is reached (last
message in the stream), nextMessage() return false (and any attempt to
read will throw an EOFException).
<p>
This package does not yet have the counterpart of "safesocks".
Cedar supports both "relisocks", which are implemented on top of
TCP, and "safesocks", which are implemented on UDP.  With a safesock,
each message is a single packet, which is a single UDP datagram.
It is thus limited to the maxiumum datagram size, which is
platform-dependent, but is generally a bit less that 64K.
(As of 3/2000, this limitation has been lifted).
